# Product-Segmentation-Model
Case - Optimizing Product Segmentation For Enhanced Merchandising Strategies. 

Objective:
The objective of this simple product segmentation model is to categorize XYZ Commodities
products into distinct groups based on their sales characteristics. This segmentation will
enable the merchandising team to make informed decisions regarding inventory management,
negotiation strategies with brand partners, and targeted marketing efforts.

Approach Taken:
I have employed K-means clustering, a widely used and interpretable technique, to create
product segments. The approach involved the following steps:

1. Data Preprocessing: I loaded and standardized the relevant sales data features
(unit_price, unit_profit, quantity, revenue, profit) to ensure consistency.
2. Determination of Optimal Clusters: I utilized the Elbow Method to select an appropriate
number of clusters (k=3) that best represents the underlying structure of the data.
3. Clustering: K-means clustering was applied to group products based on their sales
characteristics. Each product was assigned to one of the three segments.
4. Interpretation of Clusters: Cluster centroids were calculated to represent the average
characteristics

Product Segmentation Results:
Segment 1: “Value Essentials” - These products offer good value to customers without
compromising quality. These products are priced affordably, making them accessible to a wide
range of customers. They are often purchased in smaller quantities and contribute positively to
both revenue and profit.
Unit Price: $37.04, Unit Profit: $15.14, Quantity: 1.54 units, Revenue: $55.16, Profit: $21.37

Segment 2: “Popular Choices” - These include products that are frequently chosen by
customers due to their moderate pricing and reasonable quality. These products are often
purchased in larger quantities, contributing to healthy revenue and profit figures. They
represent a balance between affordability and product features.
Unit Price: $24.50, Unit Profit: $9.19, Quantity: 2.13 units, Revenue: $49.07, Profit: $17.40

Segment 3: “Premium Selection” - These encompass products that offer superior quality and
features, justifying their higher price point. Customers who prioritize quality and are willing to
invest more in their purchases opt for these products. They are often bought in larger
quantities, resulting in substantial revenue and profit contributions.
Unit Price: $34.10, Unit Profit: $13.63, Quantity: 3.61 units, Revenue: $120.15, Profit: $46.65

Business Implications:
1. Optimized Inventory Management: The Segmentation allows for the efficient allocation of
resources based on each segment’s unique demand and sales patterns, minimizing
carrying costs and reducing stockout.
2. Improving Strategic Brand Partner Negotiations: Understanding the profitability of each
segment enables prioritized negotiations with brand partners, maximizing ROI.
3. Targeted Marketing Strategies: Customized marketing campaigns tailored to specific
product segments enhance customer targeting and engagement, driving revenue growth.
4. Enhanced Operational Efficiency: Improved inventory planning, marketing strategies, and
negotiation tactics contribute to cost reductions and improve profitability.

Conclusion:
Incorporating these business implications into XYZ Commodities’ strategies and decisionmaking
processes will enable the company to leverage the power of data-driven product
segmentation for sustainable growth, improved profitability and enhanced customer
satisfaction.
